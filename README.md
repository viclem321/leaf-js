# Leaf-js

Leaf-js is a small, educational JavaScript framework built from scratch, in the spirit of libraries like React, with the goal of helping both myself and others better understand how such frameworks work under the hood.

This project is not meant for production use, but rather as a learning tool or playground. It implements a virtual DOM, fiber-based reconciliation, hooks (useState, useEffect), component rendering, and more.

## üß™ Quick Start (demo)

To get started quickly, leaf-js includes a small demo app located in [`packages/demo`](./packages/demo).

This demo showcases the main features of the framework, including components, state updates, effect hooks, and dynamic rendering.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the demo locally

```bash
yarn install
yarn compile-leaf
yarn compile-demo
cd packages/demo
npx serve .
```
Open the browser, and you're good to go!

#### üß™ Customize

You can easily modify the demo source code to experiment with your own components and ideas. Don't forget to recompile if you make changes:
```bash
yarn compile-demo
```

You can also build a brand-new site using leaf-js as a base, the demo gives you a simple starting point.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Engine (How It Works)

The full source code for the leaf-js engine is located in [`packages/leaf-js`](./packages/leaf-js). The architecture is designed to be:

- üìö Easy to read
- üí° Pedagogical
- üß© Modular and extensible

The codebase is thoroughly **commented**, and the logic follows the internal steps of React-style rendering: virtual DOM creation, fiber reconciliation, scheduling, and DOM updates.

If you want to dive into the internals and understand how frameworks like React work, or even build your own, this is the place to look.

See [`packages/leaf-js/README.md`](./packages/leaf-js/README.md) for a full breakdown of the internal structure.

## How to Use in a Real Project

Although this project is primarily educational, it can also be used in real-world projects to build functional websites.

If you want to use the compiled framework, it's available as an NPM package:

```bash
npm install @viclem321/leaf-js
```
or if you're using Yarn:
```bash
yarn add @viclem321/leaf-js
```

## FAQ

Why not just use React?
Because leaf-js is about learning, not replacing. The goal is to build something from scratch and understand the inner mechanics of frameworks like React.

What's missing?
No devtools, no concurrent rendering, no advanced diffing (yet). But everything is modular and can be extended.

## Credits

Leaf-js was inspired by Effectual, a project that reimplements a React-like framework from scratch. I discovered it while participating in a CTF event. While I did not use any of its code, the idea of building my own similar engine was born from that discovery, and I'm grateful for it.
