/**
 
  ðŸŽ¨ App.tsx - Root component of the leaf-js demo
  
  This file defines the main `<App />` component, which is always the first component rendered by the framework.
  It also contains (or imports) all other demo components used to showcase how leaf-js works in practice.

  Inside this component, you'll see several core features of the framework in action:
    - State and effect hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
    - Conditional rendering
    - add props (css style, function, key, or other)
    - Dynamic component mounting and unmounting
    - using a router

  If you're new to leaf-js, this is a great place to start exploring. Read through the code, and feel free to experiment by editing it.
