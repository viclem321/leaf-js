/** ðŸš€ MAIN RENDER FUNCTION

  This is the heart of leaf-js's rendering system.
  It performs a full synchronous render, transforming the app's component tree into DOM updates.
  This function should always be called via `runtimeState.schedulerRender.requestRender()`to avoid redundant executions and preserve batching behavior.


  This function does 5 key things:

    1. Saves the previous VDOM (`runtimeState.previousVDOM`)
    2. Builds a fresh new VDOM by evaluating all components (`createFiberTree(...)`)
    3. Compares the new VDOM to the previous one and tags nodes with changes (`diffVDOM(...)`)
    4. Commits the real DOM changes (creates, updates, deletes elements) (`commitDOM(...)`)
    5. Executes all pending `useEffect` callbacks and their optional cleanup

  
  Notes: This function is synchronous. Nothing else runs during the render. It is not concurrent or interruptible. At the end, the `runtimeState` is fully updated and ready for the next render.
