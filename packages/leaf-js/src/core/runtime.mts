/** ðŸ§  RUNTIME STATE

  This module contains the central runtime state of leaf-js. It holds global data used throughout the rendering lifecycle.
  This state is reset/updated at each render cycle and is not meant to be persistent outside the current app session.
  Think of `runtimeState` as a singleton: it stores all essential information about the current render cycle. Because there's only one shared runtime, leaf-js does not support multiple concurrent renders. Running multiple renders in parallel could corrupt this shared state and lead to unexpected behavior.
